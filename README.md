# Welcome to Play & Classify

This a simple and fun app to play with recognizing objects in images.

The application consists of 2 parts:

   The frontend is a Next JS app that is deployed to Vercel. Some of the tools used:

- Next JS
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Axios (for making API calls)
- React Toastify (for showing notifications)

2. The backend (find the backend repository [here](https://github.com/Lekipising/play-api)). The backend is a Flask app that endposes a REST endpoint for receiving selected image and giving predictions. The backend is deployed to Render.

## How it works

The user is presented with a number of predefined images where they are supposed to pick the most prominent object in the image. The user can then see how well they did and see the correct answer.
